This application searches the Stocktwits api for a list of stock symbols and renders the most recent 30 for each symbol.
The search reruns every 10 seconds as long as there is a valid query.

This is a React application. To run locally clone this repo as well as the node server into seperate files, located at https://github.com/jack8191/stocktwits-server
change urls and ports to local versions, and npm install and npm start within the directories.
